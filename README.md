## Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

As a Senior Software Engineer, I am tasked daily with the development of new features and maintenance for the world's leading ERA solution. My focus is Full-Stack Web Development utilizing C#, Angular, Microsoft SQL Server, Python, PostgreSQL, and Linux. Paired with a team of UI/UX focused engineers, I bring proof of concepts to life with a stunning User Interface. 

I have been involved in IT in one way or another since 2012 as a Software Engineer, Software Engineer Consultant, IT Consultant, Freelance Developer, Field Hardware Technician, and Project Manager.

Outside of my job, I have developed a keen interest in cybersecurity the past couple of years. I increase my knowledge through development of "boring" cryptographic libraries, books, online articles, Hack The Box, and participating in the Raptx cybersecurity community. 

I am open to connecting with like minded individuals in the Software Engineering and Cybersecurity communities.
